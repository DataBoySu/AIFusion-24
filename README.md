💼 Loan Acceptance Prediction Model<br><br>

This project is all about building a machine learning model to predict 🎯 customer loan acceptance based on a variety of demographic, financial, and behavioral features. The dataset includes information like age, income, family members, education level, years of professional experience, and more. 🏦<br><br><br>
🚀 Key Highlights:<br><br>

    🔧 Feature Engineering: Transformed income into categorical bands (lower, middle, upper middle, high) and evaluated the influence of pin codes 📍 on loan acceptance.
    🤖 Modeling: Utilized logistic regression with polynomial features to achieve high predictive accuracy. 📈
    🧪 Cross-Validation: Employed cross-validation to validate the model's performance and ensure generalization. ✅
    📊 Data Visualization: Applied extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights and visualize important patterns within the dataset. 🔍
